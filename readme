# Secure Communication with AES Encryption

This Python program allows secure communication with AES encryption and decryption capabilities. Users can encrypt and decrypt messages using a shared key calculated through the Diffie-Hellman key exchange method.

## Features

- Diffie-Hellman key exchange to derive a shared key.
- AES encryption and decryption with user-provided keys.
- User-friendly command-line interface.
- Exception handling for error scenarios.

## Usage

1. Run the program in a Python environment.
2. Follow the prompts to provide the input parameters:
   - Enter the initial values for the Diffie-Hellman key exchange: `g_e`, `g_c`, `N_e`, `N_c`, `x`, and `gy_modN`.
   - Enter the IV (Initialization Vector) in hexadecimal format.
   - Enter plaintext and ciphertext in hexadecimal format.
3. The program will calculate the shared key, perform encryption and decryption.
4. The results will be presented in a readable format.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pycryptodome` library (can be installed via pip)

```bash
pip install pycryptodome
